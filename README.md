# supervised and unsupervised learning
machine learning techniques

I will be exploring various machine learning techniques and applying them to real-world dataset.

Supervised learning comprises of classification and regression techniques, while unsupervised learning comprises of clustering. 

Some of the classification techniques include:
- Naive Bayes
- Nearest Neighbor
- Support Vector Machine

Some of the regression techniques include:
- Linear/logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods
(Neural Networks)

Some of the classification techniques include:
- K-Means
- Hierarchical & Gaussian Mixture
- Hidden Markov Model
(Neural Networks)
